## Decision Log (locked)

Decisions confirmed with the owner. Do not silently reverse — change here first.

| # | Date | Decision | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| D1 | 2026-06-10 | **English LTR now, RTL-ready** | Keep `<html lang="en">`. Build with logical CSS props (`ms/me/ps/pe`, `border-s`, `start/end`, `rtl:` variants) so a Hebrew RTL flip later = set `dir="rtl"` + add Heebo `hebrew` subset. No physical `left/right/ml/mr`. |
| D2 | 2026-06-10 | **Bottom nav = Calendar · Clients · Insights · Financials** | Matches design system. `New Booking` moved to FAB; `Add-ons` moved to drawer. `Financials` page is a "Coming soon" stub for now. |
| D3 | 2026-06-10 | **Drawer shows real business name + slug** | Pulled from Supabase via existing `useBusiness()` hook, not hardcoded. |
| D4 | 2026-06-10 | **Calendar top bar built in AppShell (not deferred)** | Done in Chat 3. The design's `☰ + Month ▾ + ⋮` calendar bar lives in AppShell, driven by a shared `CalendarChrome` context (`src/components/calendar/CalendarChrome.tsx`). The calendar page publishes its state (month label, view, status filter, date-picker, today) into the context; its old in-page toolbar was removed to avoid a double bar. Chat 4 fills the grid inside this frame. |
| D5 | 2026-06-10 | **Booking entry points — canonical** | Exactly two ways to start a booking, one way to add a contact. Booking `+` (FAB) lives **only on the calendar** (+ tap empty slot). Clients tab `+` = add-customer (name + phone), with an optional attach-booking step. Client profile "New booking for X" pre-fills the wizard. No booking `+` anywhere else. Done in Chat 6. |

## Changelog

### Chat 3 — App Shell + Login (2026-06-10)
- **AppShell rewrite** to design system:
  - Bottom nav cut from 5 tabs to 4 (Calendar · Clients · Insights · Financials). `New Booking` + `Add-ons` removed from tabs.
  - FAB added (amber `+`, fixed bottom-end, above nav) → routes to `/new-booking`. Hidden while drawer open.
  - Drawer rebuilt: real business name + slug (via `useBusiness`), items Settings · Add-ons · Usage · Profile · Sign out, slide-in animation, `dark/40` overlay, `min(320px,85vw)` width, amber active-item border.
  - Desktop sidebar: cream bg, icons **+ labels**, amber active indicator (was white bg, icons only).
  - All physical props → logical (RTL-ready per D1).
  - z-index scale normalized: top bar/nav/sidebar `z-30`, FAB `z-40`, drawer overlay `z-40`, drawer panel `z-50`, calendar ⋮ menu `z-40`.
  - Bottom nav: `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` padding for iPhone notch.
  - **Calendar top bar** (`☰ + Month ▾ + ⋮`): built in AppShell via new `CalendarChrome` context (D4). ⋮ menu = Day/Week/Month toggle + status filter (All/Pending/Confirmed/Completed/Cancelled/No-show) + Jump to today + Calendar settings. Month ▾ opens the native date picker. Calendar page now publishes state to it and its in-page toolbar was removed; status filter applies to the day/week/month views.
- **Login rewrite** to design system: white inputs `h-12`, ≥15px text (mobile-min rule), CSS amber focus ring (was inline-JS focus hack), error border state, labels 13px medium dark, amber button with hover/active states, trust line "Free consultation. No commitment.", tabs "Login / Create account".
- **Root layout**: Heebo weights extended to include 500/600/800 (design uses medium/semibold/extrabold; were faux-rendering).
- **New stub pages**: `/financials`, `/usage` — "Coming soon" placeholders so nav + drawer don't 404 (per D2).

### Chat 4 — Calendar (2026-06-10) · `152fa95`, `323a145`
- Premium week / day / month views inside the AppShell calendar frame (D4): swipeable week strip, scrollable time grid with auto-scroll to opening hour, status-colored booking blocks, tap-empty-slot-to-book, BookingDrawer.
- Premium empty state for the no-business case (welcome card + onboarding steps).

### Chat 5 — Clients List + Client Profile (2026-06-10) · `e5b61eb`
- Clients list: cream bg, white cards, debounced name+phone search (`.or`), Recent/Name/Visits sort pills, warm empty state.
- Client profile: header stats, booking history, internal notes, "New booking for X" → `/new-booking?clientId=`.

### Chat 6 — New Booking Flow + entry-point cleanup (2026-06-10) · `65aefa4`
- **Booking entry points (D5)**: FAB gated to `/calendar` only (was every screen). Clients tab gets an add-customer `+` → `AddCustomerSheet` (name + phone + optional email, with an optional attach-booking step: service + date + time). Empty-state CTA repointed to add-customer.
- **New-booking wizard rebuilt** to design system (cream page, white cards, amber, cream-2 tokens — was `bg-white`/`gray`/`amber-500`): 4-step progress indicator (Client → Service → Time → Confirm), Back never loses data, success screen with "Go to calendar" / "Add another" (replaced hard redirect).
- **Wizard bug fixes**: reads `?clientId=` → preselects customer + jumps to Service step; client search now matches phone too (`.or(name.ilike,phone.ilike)`); `alert()` → `useToast(...,"error")` everywhere; slot grid filters past times on today, renders booked slots as distinct/disabled, shows "No times available" empty state.
- **New shared lib** `src/lib/availability.ts` (`getAvailableSlots`) used by both the wizard and `AddCustomerSheet`.

## Deferred / TODO

- **FAB → bottom-sheet new-booking drawer** — currently routes to `/new-booking` page; design wants an in-place drawer pre-filled with next slot.
- **Financials** + **Usage** real pages (currently stubs — Chat 8 builds them out).
- **Hebrew RTL** flip when ready (D1): `dir="rtl"`, Heebo `hebrew` subset, translate labels.
